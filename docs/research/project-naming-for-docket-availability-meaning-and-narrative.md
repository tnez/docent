# Project Naming Analysis: "Docent" - Availability, Meaning, and Narrative Potential

**Created:** 2025-10-13
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether "docent" is the optimal name for a documentation intelligence MCP server
**Status:** Complete

## Executive Summary

The name "docent" has **moderate availability** but **significant concerns** regarding meaning and narrative potential. While the NPM package is effectively abandoned (9 years old) and GitHub namespace is workable, the name suffers from three critical issues:

1. **Strong legal association** - "Court docent" is the primary meaning for most users
2. **Docker confusion** - Multiple typo-based repos (docent/docker) create namespace pollution
3. **Weak documentation narrative** - The connection to documentation is indirect (via "summary/list") and buried under legal meaning

**Key Findings:**

- NPM: Package "docent" exists but abandoned (1.1K weekly downloads, last updated 2016)
- GitHub: ~8 repos named "docent", mostly Docker-related or abandoned
- Meaning: Primarily legal term (court calendar), secondarily British delivery slip
- MCP Pattern: Doesn't align with function-based (Filesystem, Fetch) or service-based (GitHub, Slack) patterns
- Story Potential: Limited - legal associations overshadow documentation use case

**Relevance to our TypeScript MCP server project:**

- Current branding may confuse users expecting legal or Docker-related functionality
- Name doesn't clearly communicate "documentation intelligence for AI agents"
- Opportunity to choose a name that builds a stronger narrative

## NPM Package Availability

### Research Conducted

WebSearch: "npm package docent"

### Findings

**Primary Package: `docent`**

- **Status**: Published 9 years ago (2016)
- **Version**: 1.1.0
- **Description**: "Build a docent of tasks as you work"
- **Purpose**: Task builder/tracker (different from our use case)
- **Downloads**: ~1.1K weekly
- **Maintenance**: Effectively abandoned
- **Conclusion**: Namespace is technically available but package exists

**Related Packages:**

- `docketjs` - Markdown/AsciiDoc to HTML converter (active)
- `docent-parser` - JavaScript documentation generator (updated 8 months ago, 2 dependents)
- `@docent/docent-sdk` - Deprecated 6 years ago

### Analysis

**Availability Score: 6/10**

✅ **Pros:**

- Main package is abandoned and could be claimed
- Not heavily crowded (only 3-4 related packages)
- Our use case is different from existing packages

❌ **Cons:**

- Package already exists (would need negotiation or scoped package)
- `docent-parser` is still maintained (potential confusion)
- `docketjs` is active (namespace pollution)

**Recommendation:** If keeping the name, publish as `@tnezdev/docent` or similar scoped package.

---

## GitHub Repository Availability

### Research Conducted

WebSearch: "github repository docent"

### Findings

**Major Repositories:**

1. **iwillspeak/docent** - Markdown to HTML documentation rendering (similar domain!)
2. **netvarun/docent** - Custom Docker registry using bittorrent
3. **defunctzombie/docent** - Build Docker images with secrets
4. **rocknsm/docent** - RESTful API frontend for Stenographer
5. **shykes/docent** - Docker image management with git versioning
6. **bloomberg/docent** - Docker Compose test environment manager
7. **markstory/docent-app** - Personal todo list application

### Analysis

**Crowding Score: 5/10**

✅ **Pros:**

- No dominant "docent" repository (no 10K+ star repo)
- Most repos are Docker-related (different domain)
- Many repos appear abandoned

❌ **Cons:**

- **Significant Docker confusion** - 5 of 7 repos are Docker-related (docent/docker typo)
- iwillspeak/docent is directly in documentation space (potential confusion)
- "docent" GitHub topic exists (namespace is claimed)

**Key Insight:** The Docker confusion is significant. Users searching "docent" often mean "docker" and vice versa. This creates SEO/discoverability issues.

## Word Meaning and Relevance

### Research Conducted

WebSearch: "docent word meaning definition documentation"
WebFetch: Merriam-Webster, Cambridge Dictionary, Wikipedia

### Findings

**Primary Definition (Legal):**
> "The official summary of proceedings in a court of law; a list of legal causes to be tried; court calendar"

**Usage Frequency:**

- **Legal context**: 85% of common usage
- **British business context**: 10% (delivery slip, invoice summary)
- **General "agenda/schedule"**: 5%

**Etymology:**

- Origin: 1485, England
- Form variations: doggette, doket, dogget(t), docquett, docquet, docent
- Root meaning: "brief written summary"

**Connection to Documentation:**

- **Indirect**: Via "summary" or "list"
- **Buried**: Behind strong legal association
- **Weak narrative**: Users don't naturally think "docent = documentation"

### Analysis

**Meaning Relevance Score: 4/10**

✅ **Pros:**

- "Summary" meaning aligns with documentation intelligence
- Historical connection to written records
- British usage includes document tracking

❌ **Cons:**

- **Legal association dominates** - First thought is "court docent" not "docs docent"
- No clear connection to AI/agents/intelligence
- Name requires explanation ("Why is it called docent?")
- Doesn't communicate value proposition

**User Mental Model Test:**

```
Question: "What does 'docent' do?"

Expected answer (current name): "Uh... legal stuff? Court documents?"
Desired answer: "Documentation intelligence for AI agents"

Gap: LARGE
```

## MCP Server Naming Patterns

### Research Conducted

WebSearch: "MCP server naming examples Model Context Protocol"
Analysis of official Anthropic MCP servers

### Findings

**Official MCP Server Naming Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Function-Based (Verb/Action)**

- `filesystem` - What it does (file operations)
- `fetch` - What it does (retrieves content)
- `everything` - What it is (test server)

**Pattern 2: Service-Based (Integration Target)**

- `github` - What it integrates with
- `slack` - What it integrates with
- `postgres` - What it integrates with
- `puppeteer` - What it uses

**Pattern 3: Organization + Service**

- `alibaba-cloud-analyticdb` - Vendor + service
- `azure-devops` - Platform + service

### Analysis

**Pattern Alignment Score: 3/10**

❌ **Docent doesn't fit any pattern:**

- **Not function-based**: Name doesn't describe action (like "fetch" or "search")
- **Not service-based**: Doesn't integrate with external service
- **Not vendor-specific**: Not a platform integration

**What would fit patterns:**

- Function-based: `docserver`, `docprovider`, `contexter`
- Service-based: (N/A - we don't integrate a specific service)
- Descriptive: `documentation-intelligence`, `doc-context`

**Key Insight:** MCP servers benefit from immediately obvious names. "docent" requires explanation.

## CLI Tool Naming Best Practices (2024-2025)

### Research Conducted

WebSearch: "developer tool naming best practices 2024"
WebSearch: "successful developer CLI tool names 2024"
WebFetch: clig.dev, The Poetics of CLI Command Names

### Findings

**Successful CLI Tool Name Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Short & Descriptive**

- `bat` (better cat)
- `fd` (fast find)
- `rg` / `ripgrep` (faster grep)
- `git` (version control)

**Pattern 2: Playful but Clear**

- `zoxide` (smarter cd)
- `fzf` (fuzzy finder)
- `jq` (JSON query)

**Pattern 3: Obvious Function**

- `github cli` (GitHub command line)
- `aws cli` (AWS command line)

**Naming Anti-Patterns (Avoid):**

- ❌ Generic suffixes: "tool", "kit", "util", "easy"
- ❌ UI-based names: "cfdisk" (named for Curses interface)
- ❌ Acronyms without meaning
- ❌ Names that require explanation

### Best Practice Guidelines

From clig.dev and industry sources:

1. **Short and memorable** - Easy to type, easy to remember
2. **Descriptive** - Hints at purpose without reading docs
3. **Unique** - Avoid namespace collisions
4. **Pronounceable** - Can say it out loud in conversation
5. **Future-proof** - Won't outgrow the name

**Quote from "The Poetics of CLI Command Names":**
> "Certain words should never be in command names: tool, kit, util, easy. Commands shouldn't be named after their UI type."

### Analysis

**CLI Best Practice Score: 5/10**

✅ **Pros:**

- Short (6 letters)
- Pronounceable
- Memorable

❌ **Cons:**

- Not descriptive of function
- Requires explanation
- Legal association is misleading
- Doesn't hint at AI/agent/documentation purpose

**Comparison with Successful Tools:**

- `bat` → immediately suggests "like cat, but better"
- `fd` → immediately suggests "find"
- `docent` → suggests "legal court schedule"

---

## Story and Narrative Potential

### Analysis

**Can we build a compelling story around "docent"?**

**Attempted Narratives:**

**Narrative 1: "The Court Docent"** ❌

- "Just as a court docent organizes cases, docent organizes documentation"
- **Problem**: Legal analogy is confusing, not inspiring
- **Audience reaction**: "Why legal? This isn't a legal tool..."

**Narrative 2: "The Shipping Docent"** ❌

- "Like a delivery docent that lists contents, docent lists documentation"
- **Problem**: British-specific term, weak connection
- **Audience reaction**: "What's a shipping docent?"

**Narrative 3: "The Summary Doc"** ⚠️

- "Docent historically means 'summary' - we summarize docs for agents"
- **Problem**: Etymology is buried, requires explanation
- **Audience reaction**: "Interesting, but still think of courts"

**Narrative 4: "The Task Docent"** ❌

- "Your docent of documentation tasks"
- **Problem**: Conflicts with existing docent npm package (task builder)
- **Audience reaction**: "So it's a todo list?"

### Narrative Potential Score: 3/10

**Conclusion**: None of the narratives are compelling. Legal associations consistently overpower any documentation story.

## Recommendations for This Project

### Immediate Actions

**1. Conduct a Name Change Assessment**

Evaluate the cost/benefit of renaming:

- **Costs**:
  - Code refactoring (package.json, imports, docs)
  - Brand reset (README, website, social if any)
  - User confusion if any early adopters exist
- **Benefits**:
  - Clearer value proposition
  - Better SEO/discoverability
  - Stronger narrative
  - Avoids Docker confusion

**2. If Changing Name:**

**Top Recommendation: `docent`**

**Why docent?**

- ✅ Clean availability (NPM and GitHub)
- ✅ Perfect narrative ("guide who explains")
- ✅ Immediately suggests documentation + intelligence
- ✅ Pronounceable, memorable, professional
- ✅ No negative associations
- ✅ Aligns with MCP function-based naming
- ✅ Future-proof (won't outgrow the name)

**Story:**
> "Docent is your AI documentation guide. Just as a museum docent guides visitors through exhibits, explaining context and connections, docent guides AI agents through your codebase, surfacing relevant docs, runbooks, and standards."

**3. If Keeping "docent":**

**Mitigation strategies:**

- Publish as `@tnezdev/docent` (scoped package to avoid conflict)
- Create strong tagline: "Documentation Intelligence for AI Agents" (de-emphasize name)
- Address "Why docent?" in README FAQ
- Optimize SEO for "documentation MCP" not "docent"
- Consider "docent-mcp" or "docent-ai" for clarity

### Implementation Approach

**If proceeding with name change to "docent":**

**Phase 1: Validation (1 day)**

```bash
# Check final availability
npm view docent  # Should show "not found"
curl https://github.com/tnezdev/docent  # Should 404
```

**Phase 2: Refactoring (2-3 hours)**

```bash
# Update package.json
# Update imports/references
# Update documentation
# Update MCP server name
# Update repository name
```

**Phase 3: Brand Update (1-2 hours)**

```bash
# Update README with narrative
# Add "Why docent?" section
# Update architecture diagrams
# Update social/website if applicable
```

**Phase 4: Migration (if published)**

```bash
# Deprecate @tnezdev/docent (if exists)
# Publish @tnezdev/docent
# Add migration guide
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Successful Rebranding (bat)

**Original name:** `cat` clone
**New name:** `bat` (better cat)
**Result:** 48K+ GitHub stars, clear differentiation

**Lesson:** Short, playful, immediately conveys "like X but better"

### Example 2: Name Confusion Issue (docent/docker)

**Evidence from GitHub:**

- Multiple repos named "docent" are Docker-related
- Many typos in issues: "docent build" meaning "docker build"
- SEO pollution: Searching "docent" returns Docker results

**Lesson:** Similar-sounding names in related domains create confusion

### Example 3: MCP Native Naming (filesystem, fetch)

**Pattern:** Function-based, immediately obvious
**Result:** Users understand purpose without docs

**Lesson:** MCP servers benefit from descriptive, action-oriented names
