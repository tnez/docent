## Template Usage Notes

### When to Write a PRD

Write a PRD for:

- Product vision that spans multiple features
- New product initiatives
- Major feature sets requiring alignment
- User problems at the product level
- When you need stakeholder buy-in before design

### When NOT to Write a PRD

Don't write a PRD for:

- Individual features (use RFC instead)
- Implementation details (use ADR after decision)
- Technical proposals (use RFC)
- Bug fixes or small enhancements

### PRD vs RFC vs ADR

- **PRD:** Product vision, user problems, success metrics (WHAT to build and WHY)
- **RFC:** Technical proposal, design options, trade-offs (HOW to build it)
- **ADR:** Decision made, rationale, consequences (WHAT was decided)

**Flow:** PRD → RFC(s) → ADR(s) → Implementation → Specs

### Writing Tips

- **Focus on the user:** Start with their problems and needs
- **Be measurable:** Include specific success metrics
- **Show the vision:** Paint a picture of what success looks like
- **Be realistic:** Include risks and out-of-scope items
- **Link to details:** Reference RFCs for technical approaches
- **Keep it living:** Update as you learn more about users and feasibility
