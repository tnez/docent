## Template Usage Notes

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- Architecture and system design
- Technology choices (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Development processes and workflows
- API design and contracts
- Security and compliance approaches

### Numbering Convention

- Use sequential numbering: ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.
- Zero-pad to 4 digits for proper sorting
- Never reuse numbers, even for superseded ADRs

### Status Definitions

- **Proposed:** Under discussion, not yet decided
- **Accepted:** Decision made and approved
- **Deprecated:** No longer valid but kept for reference
- **Superseded:** Replaced by a newer ADR (link to it)

### Writing Tips

- **Be concise:** Focus on the decision and rationale
- **Be specific:** Avoid vague statements
- **Capture alternatives:** Show what was considered
- **Document trade-offs:** Be honest about downsides
- **Link related ADRs:** Show how decisions connect
- **Update status:** Keep status current as decisions evolve
