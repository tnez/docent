# Implementation Roadmap
## Project Documentation Template Repository

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** Design Complete → Implementation Planning
**Version:** 1.0 (Draft)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### What We're Building

A production-ready GitHub template repository that provides a comprehensive documentation framework for software projects. The template includes structured documentation templates (ADRs, RFCs, runbooks, etc.), an intelligent installer with conflict detection and rollback, and deep Claude Code integration through custom slash commands and agents. This is a "documentation-in-a-box" solution that teams can install and immediately start using to maintain high-quality project documentation.

### Why It Matters

Most software projects struggle with documentation: it's either non-existent, outdated, or scattered across multiple systems. This template solves that by providing opinionated, tested patterns that teams can adopt immediately. The Claude Code integration makes documentation maintenance effortless through AI-assisted workflows. By making this public, we enable thousands of projects to adopt better documentation practices with minimal friction.

### Timeline Overview

- **Phase 0: Foundation** (Week 1: 6-8 hours) - Repository setup and initial structure
- **Phase 1: Core Templates** (Weeks 2-3: 12-16 hours) - Implement documentation templates

## Closing Thoughts

This roadmap takes you from design to production-ready template repository in **8-10 weeks** of part-time work. The phased approach allows for iteration and refinement at each stage, reducing risk of major issues at launch.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Start small** - Phase 0 is just a few hours
2. **Test continuously** - Every phase includes validation
3. **Get feedback early** - Beta testing prevents surprises
4. **Stay focused** - Don't add unnecessary features
5. **Be responsive** - Community engagement matters
6. **Iterate** - v1.0 doesn't need to be perfect

**Remember:**
- This is achievable as a solo developer
- The design work is done; now execute methodically
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Beta testing is crucial - don't skip it
- Launch is just the beginning

**When in doubt:**
- Refer to success criteria for each phase
- Check testing checklist for quality gates
- Review risk mitigation strategies
- Ask community for feedback

**You've got this!** The design is solid, the plan is clear, and the problem is real. Follow this roadmap, adjust as needed, and you'll have a production-ready template repository that helps thousands of projects improve their documentation.
