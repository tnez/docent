## Overview

This document defines metrics for measuring the success, adoption, and health of the Project Documentation Template repository. Metrics are organized into categories with specific targets for different time horizons.

**Key Principles:**
- **Privacy-first:** Only use metrics that respect user privacy (GitHub metrics only)
- **Actionable:** Track metrics that inform decisions
- **Balanced:** Consider multiple dimensions of success
- **Realistic:** Set achievable targets
- **Evolving:** Adjust targets as project matures

---

## Metric Categories

1. **Launch Metrics** - Initial traction and visibility
2. **Adoption Metrics** - How many people are using the template
3. **Quality Metrics** - How well the project works
4. **Community Metrics** - Health and engagement of community
5. **Impact Metrics** - Real-world outcomes

---

## 1. Launch Metrics
