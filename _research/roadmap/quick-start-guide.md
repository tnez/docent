## Step 4: Create Directory Structure (20 minutes)

### 4.1 Create Core Directories

```bash
# From repository root

# Documentation directories
mkdir -p docs/adr
mkdir -p docs/rfc
mkdir -p docs/runbooks
mkdir -p docs/troubleshooting
mkdir -p docs/api
mkdir -p docs/architecture

# Template storage
mkdir -p templates

# Installation scripts
mkdir -p scripts

# Claude Code integration
mkdir -p .claude/commands
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Testing infrastructure
mkdir -p test

# GitHub specific
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
```

### 4.2 Create Placeholder README Files

Create README.md in each docs subdirectory to document its purpose:

```bash
# docs/adr/README.md
cat > docs/adr/README.md << 'EOF'
# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant architectural choices made in this project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures a single architectural decision, including the context, the decision itself, and its consequences.

## Naming Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially: `0001-decision-title.md`

## Creating a New ADR

Use the template in `/templates/adr-template.md` to create new ADRs.

## Index

- [0001-example-decision.md](0001-example-decision.md) - Example ADR (to be created)
EOF

# docs/rfc/README.md
cat > docs/rfc/README.md << 'EOF'
# Request for Comments (RFCs)

This directory contains RFCs for proposed features and significant changes.

## What is an RFC?

An RFC is a design document proposing a new feature or significant change to the project. It's a way to gather feedback before implementation.

## When to Write an RFC

Write an RFC for:
- New features with multiple implementation approaches
- Breaking changes
- Significant architectural modifications
- Cross-cutting concerns

## Creating a New RFC

Use the template in `/templates/rfc-template.md` to create new RFCs.

## Index

- [0001-example-proposal.md](0001-example-proposal.md) - Example RFC (to be created)
EOF

# docs/runbooks/README.md
cat > docs/runbooks/README.md << 'EOF'
# Runbooks

This directory contains operational runbooks for common procedures and incident response.

## What is a Runbook?

A runbook is a step-by-step guide for performing operational tasks: deployments, backups, incident response, etc.

## Creating a New Runbook

Use the template in `/templates/runbook-template.md` to create new runbooks.

## Index

- [production-deployment.md](production-deployment.md) - Deploying to production (to be created)
- [incident-response.md](incident-response.md) - Responding to incidents (to be created)
EOF

# docs/troubleshooting/README.md
cat > docs/troubleshooting/README.md << 'EOF'
# Troubleshooting Guides

This directory contains guides for diagnosing and resolving common issues.

## Creating a New Guide

Use the template in `/templates/troubleshooting-guide-template.md` to create new guides.

## Index

- Common issues will be documented here as they arise
EOF

# docs/api/README.md
cat > docs/api/README.md << 'EOF'
# API Documentation

This directory contains API documentation.

## Creating API Documentation

Use the template in `/templates/api-documentation-template.md` to document APIs.

## Index

- API documentation will be added here
EOF

# docs/architecture/README.md
cat > docs/architecture/README.md << 'EOF'
# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains high-level architecture documentation.

## Creating Architecture Documentation

Use the template in `/templates/architecture-overview-template.md` to document architecture.

## Contents

- [overview.md](overview.md) - System architecture overview (to be created)
EOF
```

### 4.3 Commit Directory Structure

```bash
# Add all new directories and files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: create core directory structure

- Add docs/ subdirectories for ADR, RFC, runbooks, troubleshooting, API, architecture
- Add templates/ directory for documentation templates
- Add scripts/ directory for installation scripts
- Add .claude/ directory for Claude Code integration
- Add test/ directory for testing infrastructure
- Add placeholder README.md in each docs subdirectory"

# Verify commit

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Can't Push to GitHub

```bash
# Check remote configuration
git remote -v

# If using HTTPS and getting auth errors, consider SSH
# Add SSH key to GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication

# Or configure credential helper
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

### Made a Mistake in Commit

```bash
# Fix last commit message
git commit --amend -m "new message"

# Undo last commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit and discard changes (careful!)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Need to Start Over

```bash
# Delete local repository
cd ..
rm -rf <repo>

# Re-clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
```

### Repository Not Showing on GitHub
