   For each documentation directory, create a README explaining its purpose:

   ```bash
   # docs/adr/README.md
   cat > docs/adr/README.md << 'EOF'
# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant architectural choices made in this project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures a single architectural decision, including:
- The context and problem being solved
- The decision made
- The consequences of the decision
- Alternatives that were considered

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- System architecture and design patterns
- Technology choices (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Process and workflow changes
- API design and contracts
- Security and compliance approaches

## Naming Convention

ADRs are numbered sequentially:
- `0001-decision-title.md`
- `0002-another-decision.md`
- etc.

## Creating a New ADR

1. Use the template: `/templates/adr-template.md`
2. Number it sequentially (next available number)
3. Fill out all sections
4. Submit for review via pull request
5. Commit once approved

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Draft:** Under discussion
- **Proposed:** Ready for decision
- **Accepted:** Decision made, implementation can proceed
- **Superseded:** Replaced by newer ADR
- **Deprecated:** No longer applicable

## Index

*ADRs will be listed here as they are created*
EOF

   # docs/rfc/README.md
   cat > docs/rfc/README.md << 'EOF'
# Request for Comments (RFCs)

This directory contains RFCs for proposed features and significant changes.

## What is an RFC?

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a design document proposing a new feature or significant change. It includes:
- Problem statement and motivation
- Detailed design proposal
- Implementation approach
- Drawbacks and alternatives
- Open questions

## When to Write an RFC

Write an RFC for:
- New features requiring design discussion
- Breaking changes to APIs or interfaces
- Significant refactoring
- Cross-cutting concerns affecting multiple areas
- Experimental features

## RFC Process

1. **Draft:** Author writes initial proposal
2. **Comment Period:** Team provides feedback (1-2 weeks)
3. **Revision:** Author addresses feedback
4. **Final Comment Period:** Last chance for objections
5. **Accepted/Rejected:** Decision made
6. **Implementation:** If accepted, work begins

## Naming Convention

RFCs are numbered sequentially:
- `0001-proposal-title.md`
- `0002-another-proposal.md`

## Creating a New RFC

1. Use the template: `/templates/rfc-template.md`
2. Number it sequentially
3. Fill out all sections thoroughly
4. Submit as pull request
5. Engage with feedback
6. Update based on discussion

## Index

## What is a Troubleshooting Guide?

A troubleshooting guide helps diagnose and resolve specific problems:
- Symptom-based diagnosis (error messages, behavior)
- Step-by-step resolution procedures
- Root cause analysis
- Prevention strategies

## When to Create a Troubleshooting Guide

Create a guide when:
- An issue occurs multiple times
- Resolution is non-obvious
- Diagnosis requires specific steps
- Multiple solutions exist depending on cause

## Guide Format

Each guide should include:
- **Problem Description:** Symptoms and error messages

9. **Commit Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   # Check what will be committed
   git status

   # Add all new directories and files
   git add .

   # Commit with descriptive message
   git commit -m "feat: create core directory structure

- Add docs/ subdirectories for ADR, RFC, runbooks, troubleshooting, API, architecture
- Add docs/design/ and docs/research/ for design documentation
- Add templates/ directory for documentation templates
- Add scripts/ directory for installation scripts
- Add .claude/ directory for Claude Code integration
- Add test/ directory for testing infrastructure
- Add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ for GitHub templates
- Add placeholder README.md in each docs subdirectory explaining purpose

This establishes the foundation structure matching repo-structure.md design."

   # Verify commit
   git log --oneline -1
   git show --stat HEAD
   ```

### Validation Steps

- [ ] All required directories created
- [ ] Directory structure matches repo-structure.md
- [ ] Each docs/ subdirectory has a README.md
- [ ] Directories committed to Git
- [ ] Commit message is clear and descriptive

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** `mkdir` command fails
- **Solution:** Check you're in repository root, verify path syntax

**Problem:** Git won't commit empty directories
- **Solution:** That's normal - directories need files. READMEs solve this.

**Problem:** `cat` command syntax error
- **Solution:** Ensure heredoc delimiter (EOF) is on its own line with no spaces

### Acceptance Criteria

✅ Complete directory structure created matching design
✅ All documentation directories have descriptive READMEs
✅ Structure committed with meaningful commit message
✅ Directory tree is organized and logical
