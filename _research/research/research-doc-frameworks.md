## 1. Divio Documentation System / Diataxis

**Source**: https://diataxis.fr/ (formerly https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)

### Background

Originally developed by Daniele Procida at Divio, the framework has been renamed to **Diataxis** and represents a widely-adopted, pragmatic approach to documentation architecture. Adopted by hundreds of projects including Canonical/Ubuntu, Gatsby, Cloudflare, Python, LangChain, and numerous Web3 projects.

### Core Principle: Four Documentation Types

Diataxis identifies four fundamentally different types of documentation, each serving a distinct user need:

| Type | Purpose | User Need | Analogy |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Tutorials** | Learning-oriented | "Teach me" | Taking a child by the hand through a new experience |
| **How-to Guides** | Problem-oriented | "Show me how" | A recipe for accomplishing a specific task |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented | "Tell me" | An encyclopedia article with dry, factual descriptions |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented | "Explain why" | An article discussing background and context |

### Key Characteristics

**Tutorials**
- Take the reader by the hand through a series of steps
- Learning-oriented, designed for newcomers
- Must be safe, reliable, and repeatable
- Should provide immediate, tangible results
- Example: "Build your first Django app"

**How-to Guides**
- Answer questions only users with experience could formulate
- Goal-oriented and practical
- Assume some knowledge and context
- Focus on solving specific, real-world problems
- Example: "How to configure S3 bucket permissions"

**Reference**
- Technical descriptions of machinery and how to operate it
- Information-oriented, comprehensive, and accurate
- Should reflect the structure/architecture of the thing described
- Like a map: representation matches territory
- Example: API documentation, CLI flag reference

**Explanation**
- Provides background, concepts, theoretical knowledge
- Understanding-oriented, not action-oriented
- Discusses alternatives, opinions, design decisions
- Clarifies and illuminates topics
- Example: "Why we chose event-driven architecture"

### Architectural Principles

1. **Bottom-up emergence**: Discourages top-down planning; patterns should emerge from small, responsive iterations
2. **Inside-out restructuring**: Changes documentation structure from the inside rather than imposing external structure
3. **Mirroring architecture**: Reference documentation should reflect the structure of what it describes (code modules, API endpoints, etc.)
4. **Separation of concerns**: Each documentation type has different needs and should be written differently

### What Makes It Effective

- **Clarity of purpose**: Each documentation type has a clear, single purpose
- **User-centered**: Organized around user needs rather than product features
- **Actionable framework**: Provides concrete guidance on what to write and where
- **Scalable**: Works for projects of any size
- **Adoption success**: Proven across diverse projects and domains

### Implementation Recommendations

- Start by identifying what documentation you have and categorize it into the four types
- Look for documentation that tries to serve multiple purposes and split it
- Create clear boundaries between sections
- Use consistent patterns within each type
- Allow the structure to evolve through iteration

- **Serial (Oxford) comma**: Always use in lists
- **Conversational but respectful**: Sound like a knowledgeable friend

**Guidelines, Not Rules**
- The guide provides recommendations, not mandates
- Prioritize clarity and consistency for your domain
- Depart from guidelines when it improves content
- Content quality > strict adherence

### Reference Hierarchy

When questions arise, consult in this order:
1. Project-specific guidelines
2. Google Developer Documentation Style Guide
3. Third-party references (Merriam-Webster, Chicago Manual of Style)

### Key Best Practices

## 4. Write the Docs Best Practices

**Source**: https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/

### Background

Write the Docs is a global community of documentarians focused on software documentation and technical writing. Represents collective wisdom from thousands of practitioners.

### Core Documentation Principles

#### 1. Start Documentation Early

**Principle**: Begin documenting before you begin developing.

- Write requirements and specifications first
- These become first drafts of documentation
- Follows "documentation-driven design" philosophy
- Prevents knowledge loss and assumptions
- Creates shared understanding before coding

#### 2. Involve Everyone

**Principle**: Include everyone from developers to end users in the documentation process.

- Integrate documentation into standard developer workflow
- Reduce silos that isolate documentation work
- Treat docs as part of definition of done
- Enable all contributors to improve documentation

#### 3. ARID (Accept Repetition In Documentation)

**Principle**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) applies to code, not documentation.

- Business logic described in code must be re-described in docs
- Repetition serves different audiences and contexts
- Same information explained different ways for different needs
- Documentation serves learning, not code reuse

#### 4. Answer Likely Questions

**Principle**: Focus on satisfying probable questions, not all possible questions.

- Cannot create enough documentation for every obscure question
- Prioritize common use cases and workflows
- Identify and address frequent pain points
- Use analytics and user feedback to guide coverage

### Structural Best Practices

#### Write Like a Newspaper

Structure content for scanning and selective reading:

**Headings**
- Descriptive and concise
- Enable quick navigation
- Create clear hierarchy
- Summarize section content

**Hyperlinks**
- Surround descriptive words (not "click here")
- Help users understand destination before clicking
- Enable quick navigation between related topics

**Paragraphs and Lists**
- Begin with identifiable concepts early
- Front-load key information
- Use lists for scannable content
- Keep paragraphs focused on single ideas

#### Include Examples

**Principle**: Many readers look to examples first for quick answers.

- Examples save time for practical learners
- Complement explanatory text
- Show real-world usage
- Provide starting points for adaptation

### What Makes It Effective

- **Community-driven**: Reflects real-world experience, not theory
- **Pragmatic**: Acknowledges real constraints and trade-offs
- **Tool-agnostic**: Principles apply regardless of tech stack
- **Holistic**: Addresses process, people, and content
- **Evidence-based**: Derived from actual practice

### Implementation Recommendations

- Start documentation in initial project planning phases
- Make documentation part of PR/code review process
- Design documentation for scanning, not sequential reading
- Include practical examples early and often
- Use analytics to identify documentation gaps
- Foster documentation culture across entire team
