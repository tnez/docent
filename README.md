## The Problem

Most software projects struggle with documentation:
- Non-existent or outdated
- Scattered across wikis, comments, Slack, and tribal knowledge
- No clear structure or templates
- Hard to maintain as projects evolve

## The Solution

**docket** provides production-ready documentation templates that work with any project:

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Document significant architectural choices
- **Request for Comments (RFCs)** - Propose and discuss features before implementation
- **Runbooks** - Step-by-step operational procedures
- **Troubleshooting Guides** - Diagnose and resolve common issues
- **API Documentation** - Comprehensive API reference with examples
- **Architecture Overviews** - High-level system design documentation

## Quick Start

### Install via Script

```bash
# Install templates in your project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnez/docket/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Or review first
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnez/docket/main/scripts/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
