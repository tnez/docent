## The Problem

Most software projects struggle with documentation:
- Non-existent or outdated
- Scattered across wikis, comments, Slack, and tribal knowledge
- No clear structure or templates
- Hard to maintain as projects evolve

## The Solution

**docket** provides production-ready documentation templates that work with any project:

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Document significant architectural choices
- **Request for Comments (RFCs)** - Propose and discuss features before implementation
- **Runbooks** - Step-by-step operational procedures
- **Troubleshooting Guides** - Diagnose and resolve common issues
- **API Documentation** - Comprehensive API reference with examples
- **Architecture Overviews** - High-level system design documentation

## Quick Start

### Install via Script

```bash
# Interactive installation (prompts for template selection)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnez/docket/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Install specific templates
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnez/docket/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --templates=adr,rfc

# Or download and review first (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnez/docket/main/scripts/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh --help
```

### Installation Options

```bash
# Install all templates
./install.sh --templates=all --non-interactive

# Install to custom directory
./install.sh --target-dir=documentation

# Dry-run to preview changes
./install.sh --dry-run

# Overwrite existing files
./install.sh --templates=adr --force

# Backup existing files before installing
./install.sh --templates=all --backup
```

### Use as GitHub Template

1. Click "Use this template" button
2. Create your repository
3. Clone and start documenting

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tnez/docket.git
cd docket

# Run installer from your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project
/path/to/docket/scripts/install.sh --templates=adr,rfc
```

### Uninstall

```bash
# Remove installed templates
./scripts/uninstall.sh

# Dry-run to preview what would be removed
./scripts/uninstall.sh --dry-run
```
