# Agent Session - 2025-11-07

## Session Info

- **Started:** 2025-11-07 17:30:00
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Context:** ~53k tokens used

---

## Goals

> What we set out to accomplish this session

- Fix GitHub issue #13: file-issue runbook references incorrect repository

---

## Work Completed

> What was actually done

- Identified all hardcoded references to `anthropics/docent` in the file-issue runbook
- Updated 9 total references in `runbooks/file-issue.md` to correctly point to `tnez/docent`
  - Configuration examples (3 instances)
  - Command examples (1 instance)
  - Example output (2 instances)
  - Footer attribution links (4 instances)
- Verified no remaining `anthropics/docent` references exist in the codebase
- Verified TypeScript implementation already correctly uses `tnez/docent` as default in `src/core/github-cli.ts:31`
- Committed changes in commit `1b8333d`

---

## Key Decisions

**Decision:** Update all references including footer attribution links

- **Why:** The repository `github.com/anthropics/docent` does not exist - all references to it are incorrect
- **Alternatives considered:** Initially preserved footer attribution links thinking they referenced the original project
- **Impact:** Ensures all generated GitHub issues reference the correct repository

---

## Files Changed

### Modified

- `runbooks/file-issue.md` - Updated all 9 instances of `anthropics/docent` to `tnez/docent`

---

## Challenges & Resolutions

**Challenge:** Initially missed the footer attribution links

- **Attempted:** Only updated configuration and command examples
- **Solution:** User correctly identified that ALL references to `anthropics/docent` are hallucinations
- **Learning:** The repository lives at `github.com/tnez/docent`, not `anthropics/docent`

---

## Discoveries

- The `file-issue` MCP tool implementation already uses the correct default repository `tnez/docent`
- Only the runbook documentation had the incorrect references
- The issue was purely documentation drift, not a code bug

---

## Context for Next Session

### Current State

- Issue #13 is resolved and ready to close
- All repository references are now correct
- Build and markdown linting pass

### What Needs Attention
