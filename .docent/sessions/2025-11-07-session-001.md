# Agent Session - 2025-11-07

## Session Info

- **Started:** 2025-11-07T17:25:00-05:00
- **Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
- **Context:** Token budget 200K

---

## Goals

> What we set out to accomplish this session

- Fix 4 custom runbooks that were missing required YAML frontmatter
- Ensure all custom resources are properly recognized by docent

---

## Work Completed

> What was actually done

- Added YAML frontmatter to `fix-markdown-lint.md`
- Added YAML frontmatter to `install-git-hooks.md`
- Added YAML frontmatter to `release-package.md`
- Added YAML frontmatter to `upgrade-dependencies.md`
- Committed changes with proper conventional commit message
- Verified all runbooks now appear in `docent:start` output

---

## Key Decisions

**Decision:** Use consistent frontmatter structure across all runbooks

- **Why:** Ensures uniformity and maintainability
- **Fields included:** name, description, type, author, version, tags
- **Impact:** All custom runbooks now properly load and appear in docent listings

---

## Files Changed

### Modified

- `.docent/runbooks/fix-markdown-lint.md` - Added frontmatter with name, description, tags
- `.docent/runbooks/install-git-hooks.md` - Added frontmatter with name, description, tags
- `.docent/runbooks/release-package.md` - Added frontmatter with name, description, tags
- `.docent/runbooks/upgrade-dependencies.md` - Added frontmatter with name, description, tags

---

## Discoveries

> Important learnings, insights, or patterns identified

- **Frontmatter requirements:** Docent resource loader requires at minimum `name` and `description` fields for custom templates and runbooks
- **Optional type field:** The `type` field can be omitted if the file is in the correct directory (runbooks/ or templates/)
- **Graceful degradation:** When custom resources are missing frontmatter, `docent:start` displays warnings but continues to work with bundled resources
- **Pre-commit hook validation:** The git pre-commit hook automatically runs markdown linting on staged files, which passed for all changes
- **Conventional commit format:** Project follows conventional commits with prefixes like `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`

---

## Context for Next Session

### Current State

- All 4 custom runbooks now have proper frontmatter
- All custom runbooks appear in `docent:start` listings
- Changes committed to local main branch (commit 3114115)
- Still have uncommitted changes to `.docent/guides/contributing.md` from a previous session

### What Needs Attention

- The uncommitted changes to `contributing.md` should be reviewed and committed separately
- Changes are ahead of origin/main by 5 commits (should push soon)

### Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. Review and commit the contributing.md changes
2. Push accumulated commits to origin/main
3. Run health check to verify overall project state
