# Session: Consolidate docs/ into .docent/

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** Completed
**Duration:** ~30 minutes

## Objective

Consolidate the old `docs/` directory structure into `.docent/` with aggressive pruning of outdated content.

## Context

Project started with documentation in `docs/` but has since moved to `.docent/` structure. The `docs/` directory contained a mix of current and historical content that needed to be:

1. Evaluated for relevance
2. Migrated if still valuable
3. Deleted if outdated

## Work Performed

### Content Audit

**Analyzed two directory structures:**

- `docs/` - 32+ files across 11 subdirectories (adr, architecture, guides, rfcs, research, prds, specs, .journal)
- `.docent/` - 16 files across 5 subdirectories (journals, notes, runbooks, sessions)

**Identified content categories:**

- Still relevant: ADRs, architecture docs, user guides
- Outdated: RFCs (pre-MCP architecture), research docs, old journals, CLI specs

### Content Migration

**Migrated to .docent/:**

- 4 ADRs → `.docent/adr/`
  - adr-0001 through adr-0004
  - ADR-0004 (MCP-only architecture) is current
- Architecture overview → `.docent/architecture/overview.md`
- 8 user guides → `.docent/guides/`
  - MCP setup, getting started, testing, contributing, etc.

**Deleted outdated content:**

- 11 old journals from `docs/.journal/` - superseded by `.docent/journals/`
- 11 RFCs - historical proposals (either implemented or abandoned)
- 5 research documents - historical brainstorming
- 1 PRD - early vision doc
- 4 CLI specs - obsolete after MCP-only architecture decision
- `docs/README.md` - redundant with root README

### Code Updates

**Configuration changes:**

- `src/core/config.ts:43` - Removed `docs` from default search paths
  - Was: `search_paths: ['.docent', 'docs']`
  - Now: `search_paths: ['.docent']`

**Example path updates:**

- `src/mcp/tools/bootstrap.ts` - Updated docs references to .docent
- `src/mcp/tools/doctor.ts:509` - Changed ADR path suggestion
- `src/mcp/prompts/definitions.ts:19` - Updated RFC example path
- `src/mcp/tools/review-rfc.ts:12` - Updated RFC example path

**Documentation link fixes:**

- `README.md` - Updated documentation links to `.docent/` paths
- `.docent/runbooks/triage-github-issues.md` - Removed broken RFC links
- `.docent/guides/getting-started.md` - Removed broken RFC reference
- `.docent/adr/adr-0004-mcp-only-architecture.md` - Cleaned up broken references

## Results

**Final structure:**

```
.docent/
├── adr/                    # 4 Architecture Decision Records
├── architecture/           # System architecture overview
├── guides/                 # 8 user guides
├── journals/              # Daily work logs
├── notes/                 # Topic notes
├── runbooks/              # Operational procedures
└── sessions/              # AI session notes
```

**Files changed:**

- 37 files deleted from `docs/`
- 3 directories added to `.docent/`
- 5 source code files updated
- 4 documentation files updated

## Lessons Learned

1. **Default search paths matter** - Removing `docs` from config ensures only `.docent/` is searched
2. **Aggressive pruning is valuable** - RFCs and research docs were historical artifacts
3. **Internal links need updating** - Relative paths (`../rfcs/`) broke when RFCs were deleted
4. **Nested structure works** - `.docent/adr/`, `.docent/guides/` provides clear organization

## Next Steps

- Commit the consolidation changes
- Update any CI/CD scripts that might reference `docs/`
- Monitor for any broken links in remaining documentation
