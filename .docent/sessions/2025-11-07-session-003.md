- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Duration:** ~30 minutes

---

---

## Work Completed

> Successfully released docent v0.9.1 to npm

### Dependency Upgrades

**Production dependencies:**

- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk: 1.20.0 → 1.21.1

**Development dependencies:**

- @types/node: 20.19.21 → 20.19.24
- markdownlint-cli2: 0.16.0 → 0.18.1

**GitHub Actions:**

- actions/checkout: v4 → v5
- actions/setup-node: v4 → v6
- DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action: v16 → v20

### Release Process

- Ran health checks (all passing)
- Updated package version to 0.9.1
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with all changes since v0.9.0
- Committed and tagged release
- Pushed to GitHub (triggered automated publish workflow)
- Verified npm publication and GitHub release

---

## Key Decisions

**Decision:** Defer major version upgrades to future release

- **Why:** Patch release should be low-risk; major version upgrades require more testing and potentially code changes
- **Deferred:** glob 11, mocha 11, eslint 9, chai 6
- **Impact:** Keeps release focused on incremental improvements and bug fixes

## Files Changed

### Modified

- `package.json` - Version bump to 0.9.1, dependency upgrades

- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v0.9.1 release notes
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions version upgrades
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` - GitHub Actions version upgrades

## Discoveries

> Followed upgrade-dependencies and release-package runbooks successfully

- The runbooks provided comprehensive step-by-step guidance for both dependency upgrades and release process
- Automated publish workflow completed in ~1 minute (build, test, npm publish, GitHub release)
- Pre-commit hooks automatically ran markdown linting on staged files
- No issues encountered - smooth release process

---

## Context for Next Session

### Current State

- Release v0.9.1 published successfully to npm
- GitHub release created with changelog notes
- All CI checks passing
- Repository is clean and up-to-date

### What Needs Attention

- Major version dependency upgrades were deferred and should be addressed in a future release:
  - glob 10 → 11
  - mocha 10 → 11
  - eslint 8 → 9
  - chai 4 → 6
  - @types/chai 4 → 5

### Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. Monitor npm download stats and user feedback for v0.9.1
2. Watch for any issues reported in first 24-48 hours
3. Plan next release cycle for major dependency upgrades
