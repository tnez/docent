## 2025-10-13 Session: MCP Architecture Documentation Update

### Decision - Completed ‚úÖ
**ID:** dec-20251013-1
**Type:** Decision
**Status:** Completed
**File:** docs/adr/adr-0004-mcp-only-architecture.md
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~13:00

**What:** Chose MCP-only architecture over maintaining dual CLI+MCP interfaces

**Why:**
- Agent-driven audit prototype proved agents required (73/100 vs 21/100 = 3.5x improvement)
- All target users have agents (solo devs using AI as coding partners)
- CI/CD is not docket's lane (docs aren't build gates)
- CLI was scaffolding to validate approach - now commit fully

**Impact:**
- Supersedes ADR-0001 (CLI Platform), ADR-0002 (Oclif Framework)
- Removes 706 packages (72% reduction: 977 ‚Üí 272)
- Simpler architecture (one interface vs two)
- Clearer value proposition ("invisible infrastructure")

**Artifacts Created:**
- docs/adr/adr-0004-mcp-only-architecture.md (created)
- docs/adr/adr-0001-cli-platform-over-templates-only.md (updated status)
- docs/adr/adr-0002-oclif-for-cli-framework.md (updated status)

### Task - In-Progress ‚è≥
**ID:** task-20251013-2
**Type:** Task
**Status:** In-Progress (~40% complete)
**File:** docs/architecture/overview.md
**Line:** 129 (resume point)
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~14:00

**What:** Update architecture overview from CLI-first to MCP-only design

**Progress:**
- ‚úÖ Executive summary (lines 3-19)
- ‚úÖ Purpose section (lines 23-34)
- ‚úÖ Users section (lines 36-48)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies (lines 50-57)
- ‚úÖ Dependents (lines 59-64)
- ‚úÖ Architecture diagram (lines 66-125)
- ‚è≥ Component 1: Still describes "CLI Layer (oclif)" ‚Üí needs "MCP Server"
- ‚è≥ Components 2-7: Need review for CLI references
- ‚è≥ Data Flow sections: Reference CLI commands
- ‚è≥ Technology Stack: Mentions oclif (removed)
- ‚è≥ Scalability: Shows 717 packages (now 272)
- ‚è≥ ~25 more CLI references scattered throughout

**Estimated Work:** ~30 more edits, ~20 minutes

**Resume Hint:**
Start at line 129: `### Component 1: CLI Layer (oclif)`
This entire component needs rewrite to describe MCP Server instead.

**Context:**
Started during ADR-0004 creation. Scope larger than expected - file is 538 lines.
Made good progress on intro sections, but components section is substantial.

**Blocker:** None, just time-consuming

---

### Task - Pending üìã
**ID:** task-20251013-3
**Type:** Task
**Status:** Pending
**Files:** docs/specs/
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~15:00

**What:** Handle CLI command spec files (4 files referencing deleted commands)

**Files Affected:**
- docs/specs/analyze-command.md
- docs/specs/audit-command.md
- docs/specs/review-command.md
- docs/specs/analyze-command-behavior.md

**Options:**
1. **Archive** to `docs/archive/cli-specs/` (preserve history)
2. **Convert** to MCP tool behavior specs (reuse scenarios for MCP tools)

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (convert)
- Behavioral scenarios still valuable (what docket should do)
- Just need to update interface from CLI to MCP tool calls
- Preserves work that went into defining behaviors

**Next Steps:**
1. Create docs/specs/mcp-tools/ directory
2. For each spec, convert:
   - CLI command ‚Üí MCP tool name
   - Command invocations ‚Üí Tool call examples
   - Preserve all scenarios and acceptance criteria
3. Archive original CLI specs to docs/archive/cli-specs/

**Estimated Work:** ~1 hour

---

### Task - Pending üìã
**ID:** task-20251013-4
**Type:** Task
**Status:** Pending
**Scope:** docs/**
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~15:15

**What:** Search and update all remaining CLI references across documentation

**Known Locations (from audit):**
16 files contain CLI references (from grep output earlier):
- docs/guides/mcp-setup.md
- docs/rfcs/rfc-0001-mcp-server-for-agent-integration.md
- docs/rfcs/rfc-0003-workflow-orchestration-for-multi-agent-tasks.md
- docs/specs/ (4 files - covered by task-20251013-3)
- docs/research/ (2 files)
- docs/prds/ (1 file)
- docs/adr/ (3 files - some already updated)
- docs/README.md
- docs/architecture/overview.md (covered by task-20251013-2)

**Search Commands:**
```bash
grep -r "docket audit" docs/
grep -r "docket analyze" docs/
grep -r "docket init" docs/
grep -r "docket review" docs/
grep -r "CLI" docs/ | grep -v ".git"
grep -r "command-line" docs/
grep -r "oclif" docs/
```

**Strategy:**
1. Run comprehensive search to find all references
2. Categorize by file type (guides, RFCs, specs, etc.)
3. Update based on context:
   - CLI commands ‚Üí MCP tool names
   - Shell examples ‚Üí Agent conversation examples
   - "Run docket X" ‚Üí "Ask agent to analyze..."
4. Verify no broken links

**Estimated Work:** ~45 minutes

---

### Discovery - Captured üí°
**ID:** disc-20251013-5
**Type:** Discovery (Meta)
**Status:** Captured ‚Üí RFC Created
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~15:30

**What:** Discovered the exact workflow problem docket should solve

**Evidence:**
User quote: "This actually illustrates a point of friction that I want docket to solve. While working, we often identify large chunks of tasks, or things that we want to remember for later... docket should be able to take the things that it has discovered, and 'stash' them somewhere for later, but have a mechanism so those things do not get thrown into a 'bottomless pit' where they are 'never to be seen again'."

**Context:**
Experienced in real-time during documentation update:
- Started with 4 clear todos
- Discovered scope explosion (30+ edits needed)
- No good way to safely pause/resume with full context
- Risk of work vanishing into "bottomless pit"

**Impact:**
This could be docket's killer feature - solving documentation *workflow*, not just templates or assessment.

**Action Taken:**
Created RFC-0004: Work Artifact Capture and Surfacing
- Proposes work journal (.docket/journal.md)
- MCP tools: capture-work, surface-work, promote-work
- Smart surfacing based on context
- Promotion to formal docs (RFC, ADR, etc.)

**Next Steps:**
1. Dogfood this journal format during remaining doc updates
2. Refine based on what works/doesn't
3. Build MCP tools for capture/surface if validated

**This file is the prototype!**

---

### Question - Open ‚ùì
**ID:** q-20251013-6
**Type:** Question
**Status:** Open
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~15:45

**Question:** Should we finish architecture overview completely before moving to other tasks, or switch to specs/references and circle back?

**Context:**
Architecture overview is large (538 lines), partially updated (40%).
Remaining work is tedious but not complex (~30 edits).

**Options:**
A. **Finish now** (~20 min) - Complete one thing fully
B. **Switch tasks** - Tackle specs conversion, return later

**Trade-offs:**
- Option A: Maintains flow, completes one doc fully, but tedious
- Option B: Variety, spreads progress, but context switch

**User preference needed**

---

## Resume Context for Next Session

**Remaining Work (from original plan):**

### Task 6: Convert CLI Command Specs ‚è≥
**Files:** docs/specs/ (4 files)
- analyze-command.md (11KB)
- audit-command.md (16KB)
- review-command.md (17KB)
- analyze-command-behavior.md (1KB)

**Options:**
1. **Archive** to docs/archive/cli-specs/ (preserve history)
2. **Convert** to MCP tool specs (reuse behavioral scenarios)

**Recommendation:** Convert (Option 2)
- Scenarios are valuable (what docket should do)
- Just update interface: CLI ‚Üí MCP tools
- Preserves behavioral documentation work

**Steps:**
1. Create docs/specs/mcp-tools/ directory
2. For each spec:
   - Rename to match tool (analyze-tool.md, audit-quality-tool.md, etc.)
   - Update "CLI command" ‚Üí "MCP tool"
   - Update invocations: `docket audit` ‚Üí `mcp.call('audit-quality')`
   - Keep all scenarios and acceptance criteria
3. Archive originals to docs/archive/cli-specs/

**Estimated:** 45-60 minutes

### Task 7: Update Remaining CLI References ‚è≥
**Scope:** docs/** (16 files had references)

**Search commands to run:**
```bash
grep -r "docket audit" docs/
grep -r "docket analyze" docs/
grep -r "CLI" docs/
grep -r "oclif" docs/
```

**Known locations:**
- docs/guides/mcp-setup.md (may have CLI examples)
- docs/rfcs/rfc-0001-mcp-server-for-agent-integration.md (intentional CLI/MCP comparison)
- docs/rfcs/rfc-0003-workflow-orchestration-for-multi-agent-tasks.md (may reference CLI)
- docs/research/ (2 files)
- docs/prds/ (1 file)
- docs/README.md (may have CLI references)

**Strategy:**
1. Run comprehensive grep search
2. Categorize by update need (some references may be historical/intentional)
3. Update forward-looking references
4. Leave historical comparisons intact

**Estimated:** 30-45 minutes

## How This Journal Saved Us

**The Problem We Solved:**
At 16:00, we hit "low context" warning with:
- 5 completed tasks
- 2 pending tasks
- 8 modified/new files
- No clear commit strategy
- Risk of "bottomless pit" (losing track of remaining work)

**The Solution (RFC-0004 in action):**
This journal provides:
1. ‚úÖ Complete record of what was accomplished
2. ‚úÖ Clear resume points for pending work
3. ‚úÖ Commit strategy with logical grouping
4. ‚úÖ Time estimates for planning next session
5. ‚úÖ Git status and file locations
6. ‚úÖ No work lost or forgotten

**Next session starts with:**
- Read this journal
- Run git status to verify state
- Execute commit strategy
- Resume Task 6 or 7 as needed

**This validates RFC-0004's thesis:** Work capture prevents the bottomless pit.

- Ready to push to origin

---

### Discovery - Captured üí°
**ID:** disc-20251013-7
**Type:** Discovery (Architecture)
**Status:** Captured - Needs Research/RFC
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~17:45

**What:** MCP provides tools, resources, and prompts - we're only using tools

**The Insight:**
MCP servers expose three capabilities, each with distinct purposes:

1. **Tools** (what we use now) - Functions agent invokes with parameters
   - analyze, audit-quality, list-templates, get-template
   - Good for: Actions requiring computation

2. **Resources** (not using, should be!) - Content agent can read via URIs
   - Should expose: runbooks, templates, standards, docs, journal, context
   - Why: Discoverable, cacheable, feels like documentation
   - Pattern: `runbook://preview-branch`, `template://adr`, `journal://current`

3. **Prompts** (not using, THIS IS KEY!) - Pre-defined prompt templates
   - Should expose: "Review RFC", "Resume Work", "Plan Feature", "Create ADR"
   - Why: Prompts ARE workflows/slash-commands!
   - Pattern: User says "review RFC" ‚Üí agent invokes prompt ‚Üí gets full context

**Why This Matters:**
- Solves workflow orchestration more elegantly than CLI commands (RFC-0003)
- `/review-rfc` (CLI) = `Review RFC` prompt (MCP)
- Resources make documentation discoverable and cacheable
- Prompts pre-package intelligence agents can invoke

**Example - The Beautiful Pattern:**
```
User: "Can you create a preview db branch?"
  ‚Üì
Agent: [Discovery] docket.analyze() - "We use Neon DB"
  ‚Üì
Agent: [Runbook] docket.resource('runbook://preview-branch')
  ‚Üì
Agent: [Execute] Follows runbook steps
  ‚Üì
Agent: [Report] "Done! Branch created, .env updated"
```

**User Experience:** Natural conversation
**Agent Experience:** Structured intelligence
**Docket's Role:** Context provider (discovery + instructions)

**Validation:** User confirmed this pattern is exactly what they want ‚úÖ

---

### Discovery - Captured üí°
**ID:** disc-20251013-8
**Type:** Discovery (Use Cases)
**Status:** Captured - Needs Validation
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~18:00

**What:** User scenarios that define docket's value proposition

**Scenarios Explored:**

**‚úÖ Docket CAN Help (Core):**
1. Session recovery: "Haven't looked at this in a while - summary + overview?"
2. Resume work: "Can you resume work plz?" (planned/unplanned interruption)
3. Documentation health: "Is our documentation up-to-date?"
4. Onboarding: "Provide an onboarding guide for new developer"

**üü° Docket ENABLES (Via Documentation):**
5. Feature planning: "User wants X - help me plan" (templates + context)
6. Code standards: "Find violations and fix" (standards docs define rules)
7. Design consistency: "Check design/branding" (design system docs)
8. Operations: "Create preview db branch" (runbooks provide instructions)
9. Security: "Scan for PHI" (policy docs define what to check)

**‚ùå Docket Does NOT Execute:**
- Infrastructure operations (database branching, deployment)
- Security scanning (agent does this using docket's policy docs)
- Code modification (agent does this using docket's standards docs)

**The Principle:**
Docket provides **context** (discovery + instructions), not **execution**.
Documentation becomes **configuration for AI agents**.

**Pattern:**
```
Docket provides documentation ‚Üí Agent reads documentation ‚Üí Agent acts intelligently
```

**Examples:**
- Code standards docs ‚Üí Agent enforces standards
- Design system docs ‚Üí Agent checks consistency
- Runbook docs ‚Üí Agent follows procedures
- Security policy docs ‚Üí Agent implements checks

---

### Next Steps - Captured üìã
**ID:** next-20251013-9
**Type:** Next Steps
**Status:** Pending
**Created:** 2025-10-13 ~18:15

**Immediate (This Week):**
1. Research MCP SDK capabilities (resources and prompts in depth)
2. Create `docs/research/mcp-prompts-and-resources.md` exploration doc
3. Design prompt structure for common workflows
4. Prototype one prompt (e.g., "Review RFC") and one resource (e.g., `runbook://`)

**Short-term (Next Sprint):**
1. Draft RFC-0005: Enhanced MCP Architecture (tools + resources + prompts)
2. Implement resources for runbooks, templates, standards
3. Implement 3-5 core prompts (Resume Work, Review RFC, Plan Feature, Create ADR, Onboard Developer)
4. Update ADR-0004 with lessons learned

**Medium-term:**
1. Consider `docs/explorations/` as permanent doc type (space for fuzzy thinking)
2. Create exploration template
3. Workflow: exploration ‚Üí research ‚Üí RFC ‚Üí implementation

**Key Question:**
How do we surface this journal when resuming work?
- Answer documented below in "How to Resume" section

---

## How to Resume Work

**When you come back to docket in a few hours (or days), do this:**

### Step 1: Read the Journal
```bash
# In your terminal or ask your agent:
cat .docket/journal.md

# Or ask agent:
"Read .docket/journal.md and summarize where we left off"
```

### Step 2: Look for These Markers
- **Discoveries üí°** - New insights that might lead to RFCs/ADRs
- **Next Steps üìã** - Concrete actions ready to start
- **Open Questions ‚ùì** - Decisions that need your input
- **In-Progress ‚è≥** - Unfinished work with resume points

### Step 3: Check Git Status
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 4: Ask Your Agent to Surface Context
```
"I'm resuming work on docket. Read .docket/journal.md and tell me:
- What did we accomplish last session?
- What are the pending discoveries that need follow-up?
- What should I work on next?"
```

**Agent will synthesize:**
- Last session's work (commits created, tasks completed)
- Discoveries that need action (MCP resources/prompts exploration)
- Clear next steps (research MCP capabilities, draft RFC-0005)

### Future: When docket has `surface-work` tool
```
Agent: "Use docket surface-work tool"
Returns: {
  lastSession: "Completed MCP-only transition, discovered resources/prompts",
  discoveries: ["MCP prompts map to workflows", "Beautiful pattern validated"],
  nextSteps: ["Research MCP SDK", "Draft RFC-0005", "Prototype one prompt"],
  openQuestions: []
}
```

**The journal IS the prototype for `surface-work` tool!**

---

## Session Statistics (Current)

**Total Time:** ~5 hours across 2 sessions
**Completed:** 9 tasks (all original work + implementation)
**Git Status:** Clean working tree, 9 commits ready to push
**Tokens remaining:** ~82K (41% of budget)

**What Got Done Today (Continuation Session):**
1. ‚úÖ Spec conversion (4 files ‚Üí 3 MCP specs + archive)
2. ‚úÖ Doc updates (5 files with MCP-only references)
3. ‚úÖ Implementation commits (3 commits for MCP server)
4. üí° MCP capabilities discovery (tools vs resources vs prompts)
5. üí° User scenario validation (session recovery, feature planning, etc.)
6. üí° "Beautiful Pattern" confirmed (discovery ‚Üí runbook ‚Üí execute ‚Üí report)

**Major Discoveries:**
- MCP resources for documentation (not just tools)
- MCP prompts for workflows (slash-commands via MCP)
- Clear scope boundary (context not execution)
- Documentation as configuration for AI agents

---

*Session ended: 2025-10-13 ~18:30*
*Resume: Read this journal, pick from "Next Steps", or ask agent to surface context*
*Key discovery: MCP prompts/resources architecture needs RFC-0005*
## 2025-10-13T20:06:05.225Z

**Summary:** Enhanced resume-work prompt and added capture-work tool

**Key Discoveries:**
- Resource descriptions can nudge agent behavior
- Easy capture tool + opinionated descriptions = better journaling

**Next Steps:**
- Test capture-work integration
- Update documentation
- Update journal with findings

**Open Questions:**
- Should we add capture-work to other MCP workflow prompts?

---

## 2025-10-13T20:06:46.301Z

**Summary:** Phase 4 of RFC-0005: Enhanced resume-work prompt architecture and implemented capture-work tool to solve the journal-writing incentive problem.

**Key Discoveries:**
- Critical gap identified: /generate-next-prompt has full conversation history, resume-work only has written artifacts
- Solution pattern: Opinionated resource descriptions + frictionless capture tool = better journaling
- Resource descriptions can shape agent behavior through well-crafted guidance text
- capture-work tool makes journaling low-friction (structured prompts, automatic formatting, timestamp)
- Enhanced resume-work now guides agents to extract WHY (discoveries, rationale) not just WHAT (facts)
- This completes the feedback loop: easy capture ‚Üí rich journal ‚Üí effective resume ‚Üí incentive to capture more

**Next Steps:**
- Test resources end-to-end (verify journal resource, template discovery, URI security)
- Consider: Should other MCP prompts also encourage capture-work usage?
- Update README with resources/prompts examples
- Create "Using Docket Workflows" guide
- Push commits to origin (6 commits ready)
- Dogfood: Use capture-work during remaining RFC-0005 work to validate UX

**Open Questions:**
- Should capture-work be mentioned in other prompt outputs to build habit?
- Does resume-work need examples of good vs bad journal entries?
- Should we create a start-session prompt that reminds agents about journaling?

---

## 2025-10-13T20:17:27.672Z

**Summary:** Completed end-to-end testing of MCP resources and prompts - all systems working

**Key Discoveries:**
- Resources: 14 discovered (1 journal + 13 templates), all read correctly
- Security: Path traversal protection working perfectly (blocked .., ~)
- Resume-work generates 63KB prompts including full journal context
- Prompt structure validated: context gathering ‚Üí synthesis instructions ‚Üí focus on WHY
- Journal entries are immediately available to resume-work (feedback loop confirmed)
- capture-work + resume-work pattern works seamlessly

**Next Steps:**
- Consider: Should resume-work tail journal instead of including full content for large journals?
- Update README with resources/prompts examples
- Write "Using Docket Workflows" guide showing the patterns
- Clean up test-e2e.js (keep or archive)
- RFC-0005 Phase 4 nearly complete - just documentation remaining

**Open Questions:**
- Journal size management: When to summarize vs include full content?
- Should we add journal size to resource metadata?

---

## 2025-10-13T20:25:28.151Z

**Summary:** Implemented research-topic MCP prompt for structured research workflows

**Key Discoveries:**
- Research workflow is perfect use case for MCP prompts (user-invoked, structured guidance)
- Prompt provides 3-phase process: Discovery (WebSearch/WebFetch) ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Documentation
- Auto-generates filename from topic (effective-documentation-patterns-for-ai-agents.md)
- Includes project context (languages, frameworks) for relevance
- Provides complete document template with required sections
- Quality criteria built into prompt (comprehensive, actionable, well-cited)
- This replaces need for custom research-analyst agent - uses MCP-native pattern

**Next Steps:**
- Test research-topic prompt with real research task
- Consider: Should other prompts (review-rfc, plan-feature) also mention capture-work?
- Commit research-topic implementation
- Update README/docs with research workflow examples

**Open Questions:**
- Should research prompts automatically use capture-work at the end?
- Do we need a follow-up prompt for refining research docs?

---

## 2025-10-14T00:37:16.216Z

**Summary:** Completed first real-world test of research-topic prompt - researched project naming

**Key Discoveries:**
- research-topic prompt worked end-to-end! Guided through 3 phases successfully
- Docket name has moderate concerns: NPM available but legal associations dominate
- Top alternative: "docent" (9.0/10 score vs docket 4.2/10)
- Research doc followed template structure perfectly (576 lines)
- Prompt guided WebSearch + WebFetch + synthesis + documentation creation
- Quality: Comprehensive analysis with comparison matrix, recommendations, decision framework

**Next Steps:**
- Review research findings - decide on name change or mitigation
- If changing to docent: run validation, refactor code, update brand
- Commit research document
- Consider: Add more alternative names to research?
- Test other MCP prompts (review-rfc, plan-feature)

**Open Questions:**
- Should we change to "docent" given the 5/5 score on decision framework?
- Cost of rebranding now vs later?
